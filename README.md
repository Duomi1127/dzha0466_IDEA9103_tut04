In *Howl's Moving Castle*,the fire demon Calcifer's animation displays vivid expressions and dynamic effects. Though simple, the flame flexibly conveys emotions through changing shapes and colors. I plan to incorporate this technique of random form changes and color overlays into our group project, using simple dynamic elements to enhance interactivity and emotional expression. This approach will allow viewers to intuitively perceive form and emotion changes, adding fun and visual appeal even on static pages or with simple interactions.

### part2
1. The below link is what I found to help me implement the coding technique for the small flame selected in Part 1.

4. **Question:** How this coding technique might help achieve or or contribute to the desired effect?
**Answer:**
This code uses **colorMode()** to achieve layered transparency effects, which can be adjusted to a red scheme to fit the demon's theme. In the **draw() function**, switching to **blendMode(ADD)** enhances the brightness, making it more suitable for a fiery character. Keeping the **BLUR** and **POSTERIZE function** adds a soft glow effect to the animation. The **noise() function** simulates the demonâ€™s dynamic movement, adding randomness and fluidity. In the **display() method**, replacing the ghost emoji(ðŸ‘») with a flame emoji (ðŸ”¥) creates a more fitting visual, and increasing the probability of its appearance enhances the overall fiery theme of the animation.
